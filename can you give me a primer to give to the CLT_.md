FROM: \[Your Name/Community Group\]

SUBJECT: A Zero-Cost, High-Impact Proposal to Preserve Twin Coach Apartments

### **1\. Executive Summary: The Ask & The Opportunity**

This document outlines a fully-structured financial and legal model, the "Community Ownership Flywheel," designed to acquire the 25-unit Twin Coach Apartments. Our goal is to transition the property into a Limited Equity Co-operative (LEC), placing it under a permanent Community Land Trust (CLT) ground lease.

We are writing to you today to propose that **Home,** Inc. serve as the CLT **"anchor" for this project.**

The key benefit of this model is that it is structured to **require zero capital outlay from Home, Inc.** while achieving our shared mission: the permanent preservation of 25 units of affordable housing in Yellow Springs. This model allows you to fulfill your stewardship role, funded by the project itself, without deploying your own limited capital.

### **2\. The Challenge: A Ticking Clock for Local Housing**

As we all know, Yellow Springs is at high risk of losing its naturally occurring affordable housing (NOAH) to out-of-town, speculative investment. Twin Coach is a prime example. A conventional market sale would almost certainly lead to rent hikes and the displacement of long-term residents, permanently removing these 25 units from our community's affordable stock.

Our model is a direct intervention designed to intercept this process by providing a superior financial outcome for the seller *and* a permanently affordable future for the residents.

### **3\. The "Flywheel" Solution: A 4-Stakeholder Partnership**

The model works by aligning the interests of four key groups. Your role as the CLT is the most critical, as you provide the permanent legal foundation for the entire deal.

1. **The Seller (Paul):** Instead of a conventional sale, the seller executes a **bargain sale**. They **donate the land** to Home, Inc. for a massive, multi-year tax deduction and sell the building at a reduced price.  
2. **The Investor LLC:** A group of local, mission-driven investors provides the cash for the down payment and for **all major capital improvements** (e.g., a new roof, new paving), which are needed immediately. Their return is provided by federal tax incentives, not by the residents' rent.  
3. **The** Resident **Co-operative:** The tenants form a legal co-op. During a 7-year "incubation period," they operate the building and build shadow equity. After 7 years, they buy out the investors at a pre-negotiated price.  
4. **Home, Inc. (The CLT):** You are the permanent anchor.

### **4\. The Specific Role & "Win" for Home, Inc.**

Your role is twofold, and it is fully funded by the project's operating budget.

**Role** 1: The Land **Steward (The "Anchor")**

* **The Action:** You accept the **tax-deductible donation of the land** from the seller. This is the "bargain element" of the sale.  
* **The Mechanism:** You immediately place this land under your standard 99-year, renewable ground lease. This is the **"mission lock"** that guarantees the property remains affordable in perpetuity, which your organization is set up to do.  
* **The** "Win": You acquire a high-value community asset and secure 25 units of permanent affordability **at zero acquisition cost.**

**Role 2: The Co-op's Mentor (The "Incubator")**

* **The Action:** The residents will need guidance. We are asking Home, Inc. to act as the professional mentor for the newly-formed Twin Coach Co-operative during the 7-year incubation period.  
* **The Mechanism:** As detailed in the project's pro forma, the operating budget includes a **$15,000 annual "Professional Management Fee."** We propose this fee be paid directly to Home, Inc. (or a partner you designate) to provide:  
  1. **Governance Training:** Helping the residents elect their board, run meetings, and read financials (as seen in the "Role of Executive Committee" slide).  
  2. **Technical Assistance:** Providing oversight on maintenance, operations, and compliance.  
* **The "Win":** You receive a **new, stable, $15,000 annual revenue stream** to fund your stewardship and educational mission, all paid for by the project's own solvent rent structure.

### **5\. Why This is a "Win-Win-Win-Win"**

This model is a balanced "mix" where every stakeholder's primary need is met.

* **The Seller** gets a better after-tax return and is relieved of management burdens.  
* **The Investors** get a secure, tax-advantaged, impact-first investment.  
* **The Residents** get stable, affordable rent and a clear path to ownership.  
* **Home, Inc.** achieves its core mission—**25 new units of permanent affordable housing**—with no capital outlay and is *paid* to perform its stewardship role.

### **6\. Our Request & Next Steps**

We have a robust, third-party-reviewed financial model that shows this deal is viable for all parties. However, we cannot formally approach the seller or the investors without our most important partner.

We are seeking a **contingent commitment from the Home, Inc. Board** to serve as the CLT and co-op mentor for this project, *contingent* upon us successfully securing the seller's agreement and the necessary investor capital.

This commitment is the key that unlocks the entire deal. We would be happy to present
