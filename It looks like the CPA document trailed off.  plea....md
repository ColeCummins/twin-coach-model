SUBJECT: Request for Technical Review & Tax Analysis of the "Community Ownership Flywheel" Model

### **1\. Executive Summary: The Ask**

We have developed a financial model for a proposed acquisition of the 25-unit Twin Coach Apartments in Yellow Springs. The goal is to preserve it as permanently affordable housing by transitioning it to a Limited Equity Co-operative (LEC) anchored by a Community Land Trust (CLT).

This model, which we call the "Community Ownership Flywheel," is designed to be a self-sustaining, "win-win-win-win" transaction. Its viability hinges on a specific, layered interpretation of current US and Ohio tax law.

We are seeking your professional expertise to **conduct a critical peer review of our financial logic and tax assumptions** to identify any flaws, risks, or compliance issues before we present this proposal to the stakeholders. Our full, interactive financial model (a self-contained HTML file, v31) is available for your review, and its core logic is detailed below.

### **2\. The Transaction Structure: A 4-Stakeholder Partnership**

1. **The Seller (Landlord):** Executes a **bargain sale** of the property, donating the land to the CLT and selling the building to a new Investor LLC.  
2. **The Community Land Trust (Home, Inc.):** A 501(c)(3) that receives the land donation and places it under a 99-year ground lease, ensuring permanent affordability.  
3. **The Investor LLC (Steward):** A for-profit, mission-aligned LLC that provides the bridge capital for the down payment and all Year 1 capital improvements (roof, paving, etc.). They hold the property for 7 years.  
4. **The Resident Co-op (Future Owner):** The tenants form a co-op that manages the property and builds equity, executing a pre-negotiated buyout of the Investor LLC in Year 7\.

### **3\. Key Tax & Financial Mechanisms for Your Review**

Our model's success depends on the correct application of three key tax-driven mechanisms.

#### **Mechanism 1: The Seller's Bargain Sale (IRC §170)**

This mechanism is designed to provide the seller a superior after-tax return, making the deal possible.

* **The Transaction:** The seller donates the land (FMV \- Sale Price) to the CLT and provides seller financing for the building.  
* **Our Assumption (Benefit 1):** The seller receives a large charitable contribution deduction equal to the donated land's value, which can be carried forward for up to 5 additional years.  
* **Our Assumption (Benefit 2):** The model assumes the seller can use this deduction carryover to shield the ordinary income (interest payments) they receive from the seller-financed note, subject to the 30% of AGI limitation for capital assets.  
* **Key Question for You:** Is our interpretation of the AGI limitation and the application of the charitable deduction against the note's interest income a sound and standard tax strategy?

#### **Mechanism 2: The Investor's Return (IRC §168 & §469)**

The investor's return is driven *entirely* by tax benefits, as their pre-tax cash flow is zero.

* **Source of Losses:** The investor's "paper losses" are generated by mortgage interest, ground lease payments, and, most importantly, depreciation.  
* **Bonus Depreciation (IRC §168(k)):** We have built the model to be conservative. It **defaults to the TCJA phase-down (40% in 2025, 20% in 2026, 0% in 2027\)**, which the user selects. An "Optimistic (100%)" toggle is available, but our base case is 40%.  
* **Passive Activity Loss (PAL) Limitations (IRC §469):** This is our most critical assumption.  
  * The model includes a toggle for "Qualified Real Estate Professional" status.  
  * For non-professionals, it **limits the usable paper loss** in any year to their "Available Passive Income to Offset" (a user input).  
  * Any unused losses are tracked as **"suspended losses"** and carried forward.  
* **Key Question for You:** Have we correctly modeled the PAL limitations? Specifically, is our assumption that suspended losses are "freed" upon the sale in Year 7 to offset the gain from that sale a correct interpretation of the rules?

#### **Mechanism 3: The Exit & The "Equity Kicker"**

This is how the deal is balanced and the Co-op's buyout is made feasible.

* Depreciation Recapture: We are modeling that the investors must pay tax on their "paper gain" at exit. We calculate this gain as:  
  Amount Realized \- Adjusted Basis \- Suspended PALs \= Final Taxable Gain  
  This gain is then taxed at federal recapture (25%), state, and NIIT (3.8%) rates.  
* **The "Equity Kicker":** This is our refinement of the "Community Reinvestment" idea. It is a pre-negotiated percentage of the *total* Year 1 CAPEX (not just bonus-eligible assets). This is structured as a **reduction in their final capital repayment**.  
  * This directly **lowers the Co-op's buyout price.**  
  * It also **lowers the investor's "Amount Realized,"** which in turn reduces their taxable gain, making it a tax-efficient way to provide the benefit.  
* **Key Question for You:** Is this "Equity Kicker" mechanism a legally sound and defensible way to structure the community benefit? Would you recommend an alternative (e.g., a formal grant, a preferred equity structure) that is cleaner?

### **4.0 Identified Risks for Your Review**

* **Bargain Sale Appraisal:** The land/building value split must be defensible for the seller's Form 8283\. Our model flags any land ratio over 50% as a high-risk "red" light, assuming a qualified MAI appraisal is non-negotiable.  
* **Property Tax Exemption:** The model's long-term rent affordability hinges on Home, Inc. (a 501(c)(3)) successfully applying for a property tax exemption under **Ohio Revised Code §5709.12**. This is a major dependency.  
* **Securities Law:** We are aware that the Investor LLC raise is a securities offering and must be structured to comply with federal (Reg D) and Ohio state law, requiring a PPM.

We would be grateful for your critical review of these assumptions. Our goal is to ensure this model is not just optimistic, but **defensible** and **compliant** before we proceed.

Thank you,
