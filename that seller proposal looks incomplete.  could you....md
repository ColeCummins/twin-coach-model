SUBJECT: A "Win-Win" Proposal for the Sale of the Twin Coach Apartments  
We are writing to you as a group of Yellow Springs community members who respect the legacy you've built with the Twin Coach Apartments. We have been working with financial and tax advisors to develop a unique "Community Ownership Flywheel" model for a potential sale.

Our proposal is designed to achieve two goals simultaneously:

1. Provide you with a **superior after-tax financial return** compared to a conventional, brokered sale.  
2. Preserve the property as permanently affordable housing for the residents, securing a lasting positive legacy for you in the village.

Based on our financial modeling (using the conservative 40% bonus depreciation law for 2025), this proposal could deliver a total net value of **$1.78 million** to you over seven years. This is approximately **$91,000 (a 5.4% advantage)** over the estimated **$1.69 million** you would net from a conventional sale, while also relieving you of all management burdens immediately.

### **The Problem with a Conventional Sale: "Value Leakage"**

In a standard market sale, a large portion of your life's work—your equity—is "leaked" to third parties. Based on an assumed **$2.3M** fair market value:

* **Broker Commissions (at 6%):** You would immediately pay **$138,000** to a broker.  
* **Capital Gains & Recapture Tax:** You would then face a very large, one-time federal and state tax bill on your gain, which we estimate to be over **$470,000**.

This means that of your $2.3M asset, **over $608,000 could be lost** to taxes and fees, leaving you with an estimated **$1.69M** in net proceeds.

### **Our "Flywheel" Solution: How You Get a Better Return**

Our model is different. It's a "bargain sale" structure, designed in partnership with Home, Inc., that *captures* the value normally lost to taxes and brokers and, instead, converts it into a more efficient, long-term return for you.

This is a **4-step process** from your perspective:

1. **The Bargain Sale:** You would sell the **building** to a local, mission-driven Investor LLC for **$1.2M**. You would simultaneously **donate the land** (valued at $1.1M) to **Home, Inc.**, our trusted local CLT.  
2. **The Immediate Tax Benefit:** This land donation generates a **$1.1M charitable tax deduction** for you. This is a massive tax asset you can use to shield your income for up to six years.  
3. **The Secure Retirement Income:** The Investor LLC pays you **$240,000** as a cash down payment. You then provide a **seller-financed note** for the remaining **$960,000**. This provides you with a stable, passive income check of **\~$82,726 every year** for seven years, *and* a large portion of that interest income is shielded from taxes by your donation deduction.  
4. **The Clean Exit:** From Day 1, you are **done**. The Investor LLC and Home, Inc. take over all ownership, management, and operational burdens, including the **$250,000 in capital repairs** (like the new roof) that they will fund.

### **Financial Breakdown: Conventional Sale vs. Our Model**

This side-by-side comparison shows the clear financial advantage of this model for you.

| Financial Metric | Conventional Sale (Estimate) | Community Flywheel Model (Projected) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Sale Price / FMV** | $2,300,000 | $2,300,000 |
| Broker Commissions | ($138,000)\</span\> | \<span style="color:green"\>$0\</span\> |
| Tax-Deductible Donation | $0 | $1,100,000 |
|  |  |  |
| **Cash at Closing (Day 1\)** | \*\*$1,691,888\*\* |  |
| *Taxes on Sale* | \<span style="color:red"\>($470,112) | ($264,604)\</span\> |
| *Cash Down Payment* | N/A | $240,000 |
| **Net Cash (Day 1\)** | \*\*$1,691,888\*\* | **($24,604)** |
|  |  |  |
| **Cash Over Time (Yrs 1-7)** | $0 | $1,807,841 (Net Payments \+ Balloon) |
|  |  |  |
| **Total Net Value (In-Pocket)** | \*\*$1,691,888\*\* | \*\*$1,783,237\*\* |
| **Your Financial Advantage** | **\-** | \+$91,349 (5.4%)\</span\> |

This model converts your illiquid real estate asset into a stable, passive, and tax-advantaged income stream that ultimately puts more money in your pocket.

### **Our Partners & Your Security**

You would not be in business with an untrained group.

* **The Buyer:** The "Investor LLC" is a group of local, mission-driven, and well-capitalized Yellow Springs residents who are providing the cash to make this deal work. Your loan is secured by their capital.  
* **The Land Steward:** Home, Inc. is our community's most trusted housing partner and will serve as the permanent anchor, ensuring the mission is protected.  
* **The Future:** The residents will be professionally trained by Home, Inc. to manage the property themselves, preparing them to buy the building from the investors in Year 7\.

### **Our Request**

We know this is a different approach, but it is one that creates a win for everyone. We have a fully interactive financial model that shows exactly how these numbers work.

We are asking for your willingness to explore this proposal. We would like to arrange a no-obligation meeting with you and your financial advisors to walk through the model in detail
