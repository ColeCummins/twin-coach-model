TO: Our Neighbors and Fellow Residents of the Twin Coach Apartments  
FROM: \[Your Name / A group of your neighbors\]  
DATE: November 5, 2025  
SUBJECT: A Plan to Secure Our Homes Together  
We are all aware that our building may be for sale. In a typical sale, a new landlord buys the property, raises the rents to maximize their profit, and we are left with no stability and no voice.

We are writing to you today to propose a different path.

We have been working with local partners, including **Home, Inc.**, to develop a financial model that allows **us, the residents, to take control of our building** and convert it into a permanently affordable, resident-owned community.

This is a plan to ensure that Twin Coach remains our home, that our rents stay stable, and that we, the people who live here, get to make the rules.

### **The Big Idea: The "Community Ownership Flywheel"**

Instead of one person's profit, this model is built on a "win-win-win" partnership between four groups, all with the same goal:

1. **The Seller (Paul):** We have a plan that offers him a better, more secure financial retirement package than a conventional sale.  
2. **Local Investors:** A small group of mission-driven Yellow Springs investors will provide the cash for a new roof and other major repairs *immediately*. They are "capital partners," not new landlords, and their return comes from tax benefits, *not* from our rent.  
3. **Home, Inc. (Our Local CLT):** Home, Inc. will own the land under our building *forever*. This is the most important part. It creates a **"permanent affordability lock,"** meaning the property can *never* be sold to a for-profit developer.  
4. **The Twin Coach Co-operative (Us):** We, the residents, will form a non-profit co-operative. We will get to vote on the rules, elect our own leadership, and manage our own community.

### **What This Means for You: The "Win"**

This plan is not a dream; it's a 7-year process to take full ownership. Here is what it means for you from Day 1\.

#### **1\. Stable, Affordable Rent (Called "Carrying Charges")**

Because the land is donated and the repairs are funded by tax-advantaged capital, our monthly housing cost is based on the *real* costs of running the building (the mortgage, maintenance, etc.), not on whatever the market will bear.

Our financial model, which is based on current, conservative tax law, shows we can lock in our monthly carrying charge at approximately **$717 per unit.** This cost would only increase to cover real expenses (like utilities), not to make someone a profit.

#### **2\. You Are in Control (Democratic Governance)**

This will be *our* community. As a co-op, we will all have one vote on the big decisions. We will use the exact structure from the slides you've seen:

* **We Vote on the "By-Laws":** We'll decide how often we meet, what our voting rights are, and how we elect our leadership.  
* **We Elect an "Executive Committee":** We'll elect our neighbors to manage the day-to-day operations, like collecting rent, paying the bills, and handling maintenance requests.  
* **We Set the "House Rules":** We, as a community, will get to decide on the rules for parking, noise, pets, and maintenance.

#### **3\. We Build Wealth Together (The 3 Equity Channels)**

Even before we are the full owners, our community will be building wealth in three ways:

1. **"Shadow Equity" (Paying Our Own Loan):** A portion of our monthly rent payment will go to paying down the principal on the building's mortgage. Every dollar we pay down is a dollar we *don't* have to borrow when we buy the building in 7 years.  
2. **"Sweat Equity" (Managing Ourselves):** The building's budget includes **$15,000 per year** for a property manager. We are proposing that our co-op *is* the property manager. We will do the work (with professional training from Home, Inc.) and that $15,000 fee will be paid *directly to our co-op's bank account*. This is our first source of community-owned capital.  
3. **"Shared Benefit" Equity (The Investor Kicker):** The investors who are paying for the new roof will get a tax benefit. As a "thank you" for this deal, they have agreed to give the co-op a large "kicker" (a discount) on the final sale price. This will lower our mortgage and make the final purchase much easier.

### **The 7-Year Plan: A "Guided Path" to Ownership**

This is a two-phase plan, and we will have professional help every step of the way.

* Phase 1: The Incubation (Years 1-7)  
  The investors will be the temporary owners on paper, which protects the seller. But we, the Co-op, will be the managers. We will be responsible for our community, and Home, Inc. will be our paid trainer and mentor, teaching us everything we need to know about governance and finance.  
* Phase 2: The Buyout (Year 7\)  
  After 7 years of training and building equity, the Co-op will "graduate." We will use all the equity we've built to get our own mortgage and buy the building from the investors at the pre-negotiated, fair price. From that day on, we are the full owners, forever protected by the Home, Inc. land trust.

### **Our Next Step: A Community Meeting**

This entire plan depends on one thing: **us.** It only works if we, the residents, want to do this together.

We will be holding a community meeting for all Twin Coach residents to discuss this proposal in full, answer all your questions, and hear your thoughts.

When: \[Date of Meeting, e.g., Thursday, November 13th at 7:00 PM\]  
Where: \[Location, e.g., The Community Room\]  
This is a rare opportunity to take control of our future, secure our homes, and build a stable, resident-owned community in the spirit of Yellow Springs.
