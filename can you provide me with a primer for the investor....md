SUBJECT: Investment Opportunity: The Twin Coach Community Ownership Flywheel

### **1\. The Executive Summary: The "Win-Win-Win"**

This document outlines a time-sensitive, tax-advantaged impact investment opportunity to preserve the 25-unit Twin Coach Apartments. We are seeking a small group of local, mission-aligned investors to form an LLC and provide the bridge capital necessary to acquire the property, in partnership with Home, Inc. and the current residents.

* **The Mission:** To transition Twin Coach into a permanently affordable, resident-owned Limited Equity Co-operative (LEC), protecting 25 families from displacement and preserving a vital piece of our community's affordable housing stock.  
* **The Ask:** A total capital raise of **$525,000** (from approx. 5 investors at $105,000 each) to fund the down payment, all immediate capital repairs (including a new roof), and deal costs.  
* **The Financial Return:** A projected **10.15% after-tax Internal Rate of Return (IRR)** over a 7-year hold period. This return is generated almost entirely from federal and state tax benefits, not from the residents' rent.  
* **The Exit:** A pre-negotiated, contract-based buyout in Year 7 by the Resident Co-operative, at which point your initial capital is returned.

### **2\. The Problem: A Ticking Clock on Affordability**

Twin Coach is a prime example of "naturally occurring affordable housing" (NOAH) that is at high risk. A conventional market sale would almost certainly lead to a new owner dramatically increasing rents to match the market, displacing long-term residents and permanently removing these 25 units from our community's affordable stock.

### **3\. The "Flywheel" Solution: How We All Win**

This model is a partnership that captures value normally lost to taxes and fees.

1. **The** Seller **(Paul):** Executes a "bargain sale," donating the land to Home, Inc. for a massive tax deduction and selling the building to the Investor LLC. This provides him a superior after-tax return and relieves him of all management burdens.  
2. **Home, Inc. (The CLT):** Receives the land donation at zero cost and places it under a permanent 99-year ground lease, ensuring the "mission lock" of permanent affordability.  
3. **The Investor LLC (You):** You provide the **$525,000** in capital. This funds the seller's down payment and, critically, pays for **$250,000 in immediate capital improvements** (new roof, paving, etc.). You are the temporary, 7-year "steward" of the property.  
4. **The Resident Co-op:** The tenants form a co-op and, with professional training from Home, Inc., manage the property themselves. Their rent is set to be solvent—it only covers the building's true costs (Paul's note, the ground lease, taxes, etc.).

### **4\. The Investor's Financial "Win": How You Get Paid**

Your role is a "capital partner," not a landlord. Your pre-tax cash flow from operations is zero by design. **Your entire return is generated by tax incentives.**

Here is the 7-year pro forma for the Investor LLC, based on the conservative 2025 (40% bonus depreciation) tax law:

| End of Year | Annual Deductible Loss | Annual Tax Savings | Annual After-Tax Cash Flow | Cumulative After-Tax Cash |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **0 (Invest)** |  |  |  | **($525,000)** |
| **1** | ($261,313) | $96,066 | $76,566 | ($448,434) |
| **2** | ($174,113) | $64,307 | $64,307 | ($384,127) |
| **3** | ($174,113) | $64,307 | $64,307 | ($319,820) |
| **4** | ($174,113) | $64,307 | $64,307 | ($255,513) |
| **5** | ($174,113) | $64,307 | $64,307 | ($191,206) |
| **6** | ($174,113) | $64,307 | $64,307 | ($126,899) |
| **7 (Sale)** | ($174,113) | $64,307 | $427,087 | **$300,188** |
| **Total** |  | **$541,908** | **$825,188** | **$300,188 (Net Profit)** |

#### **How This Works:**

1. **The Engine (Bonus Depreciation):** In Year 1, your LLC invests $525,000. You immediately get to claim a "paper loss" of **$261,313**. This loss is generated by the interest payments, operating costs, and (most importantly) the **40% bonus depreciation** on $130,000 of capital improvements (paving, fixtures, appliances).  
2. **The** Return **(Tax Savings):** For an investor in the 35% federal tax bracket, this $261,313 loss creates **$96,066** in real cash savings by shielding your other income from taxes.  
3. **The "Equity Kicker":** As a key community benefit, the LLC agrees that the Co-op's buyout price will be reduced by an "Equity Kicker" of **$25,000** (10% of the total CAPEX). This is paid from your tax savings in Year 1, but it *also* reduces your taxable gain at the exit, making it a highly efficient way to give.  
4. **The Exit (Year 7):** The Co-op refinances and repays your initial capital, less the Kicker. You must then pay "depreciation recapture" tax on the paper gains you've realized. The final line item ($427,087) is your final year's tax savings *plus* your net capital return after all taxes are paid.

The final result is a **10.15% after-tax IRR** and a **$300,188** net profit on a $525,000 investment.

### **5\. Critical Risks & Transparency (Who is this for?)**

This is a specialized investment, and it is not for everyone. The tax benefits are subject to two key limitations:

1. **Tax Law Risk:** The 10.15% IRR is based on the **conservative,** current 40% bonus depreciation law **for 2025\.** If the deal is delayed to 2026, the rate drops to 20%, and the IRR falls. This creates a powerful "why now?" imperative.  
2. **Passive Activity Loss (PAL) Risk:** This is the most important qualifier. The IRS limits the use of "paper losses" for non-real-estate professionals. This investment is therefore ideal for two types of people:  
   * **"Qualified** Real Estate Professionals" (who can use the losses to offset their active income).  
   * **Individuals with significant existing "Passive Income"** from other rentals or businesses (who can use these losses to offset that income).

### **6\. The Non-Financial "Win": A Legacy Investment**

This is a true "flywheel" that captures value for the community. Your capital allows the Seller to get a great return, which allows the Co-op to be created, which allows Home, Inc. to secure the land. Your investment is the "push" that sets this entire cycle in motion.

The result is the permanent preservation of 25 affordable homes and the creation of a stable, empowered, resident-owned community in the heart of Yellow Springs.
